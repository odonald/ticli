"""The agent surface: ticli for callers that are programs.

`ticli agent <verb>` is a headless, JSON-speaking sibling of the TUI, built
after two sessions proved agents will otherwise interact with ticli the worst
way — importing internals, writing throwaway scripts, and firing requests at
a rate that has already gotten the owner's IP blocked by TIDAL once. Every
verb here goes through `utils.throttle`, so the working rules' rate limits
are enforced by code rather than by an agent having read them.

Contract, held everywhere:

- **stdout is JSON, always exactly one object.** Success is `{"ok": true,
  ...}`; failure is `{"ok": false, "error": <code>, "message": ...,
  "hint": ...}` and a nonzero exit. Anything meant for a human goes to
  stderr. An agent must never have to parse prose.
- **Errors are structured and honest.** `not_logged_in`, `rate_limited`
  (the trip — includes what tripped it and that a *human* clears it),
  `auth_failed`, `api_error`, `not_found`. Never a stack trace on stdout,
  never a silent empty result for what was actually a failure.
- **Requests are counted and spaced.** Each verb documents its request cost
  in `--help`; each network call takes one `throttle.acquire()` first. A 429
  or a 401/subStatus-4006 trips the stop for every future agent call until
  `ticli agent unblock`.

This module must not import `ticli.player` — that is the whole TUI's import
chain, and both `ticli --help` and `ticli agent --help` stay instant by
keeping tidalapi and player imports inside the functions that need them.
The playlist mutations here deliberately do not touch the running player's
queue or state files; a live TUI notices new playlists the way it notices
them changing on the server, by fetching.
