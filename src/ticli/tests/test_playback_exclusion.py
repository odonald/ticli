"""Tests for the one-process-at-a-time invariant on the audio backend.

`AudioPlayer` keeps exactly one handle to a player subprocess — `_process` —
and that handle is the *only* way anything is ever stopped, paused, seeked or
shut down. So a spawn that lands while another process is still alive does not
merely leak: the loser keeps decoding, keeps making sound, answers to nothing
(mpv's IPC socket is one fixed path per ticli pid, so the last spawn owns it),
and survives the app exiting. That is two songs at once out of one client.

The invariant these tests hold down is therefore about *processes*, not about
bookkeeping: every process ever spawned, except the one `_process` currently
names, must have been terminated or killed. Asserting that `_process` points at
the newest spawn passes with the bug fully present and proves nothing — which
is the ai/INCIDENTS #2 shape, and is exactly what the pre-existing fakes in
test_player_controls.py and test_cache.py cannot see (neither defines
`terminate`, and one makes `poll()` return None forever).

The mechanism guarded here: `play_url` used to call `stop()` — which takes
`_lock`, reaps, and *releases* — and only then re-acquire `_lock` to spawn.
Two starts arriving inside one reap each spawned a backend, because the loser's
`stop()` ran after the winner had already set `_process = None` and so reaped
nothing. See ai/INCIDENTS.md and ai/BUGS-2026-07-24-resume-trace.md item 4,
which predicted this exact failure ("tighter interleaving double-spawns mpv →
orphaned process, double audio") and whose third prescribed fix never shipped.

No TIDAL session and no real player process.
