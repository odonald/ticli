# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Ticli: a terminal music player for TIDAL. Streams lossless/hi-res audio directly from TIDAL's API via tidalapi + ffplay.

## Repository Layout

- `src/` — Python package (`ticli`)
  - `ticli/player.py` — Main player (TUI, audio, search, queue, playlists)
  - `ticli/cli.py` — Click CLI entry point
  - `ticli/utils/credential_store.py` — Secure OAuth token storage
  - `ticli/tests/` — E2E tests

## Commands

```bash
# Activate the Python environment
source ./src/.venv/bin/activate

# Install the package (editable)
cd src && pip install -e ".[keyring]"

# Run tests
pytest ticli/tests/ -v

# Launch the player
ticli
ticli --quality HIRES
```

## Architecture

Ticli uses `tidalapi` (community Python client) to authenticate via OAuth and fetch audio stream URLs. Audio is played through ffplay (from ffmpeg). The TUI is built with Rich's `Live` display.

### Audio Playback

- ffplay: kills process on pause (instant silence), caches audio to local temp file, restarts from cache on resume
- mpv (if available): uses IPC socket for pause/resume

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `player.py` | Player TUI, audio control, search, queue, playlists (~1400 LOC) |
| `cli.py` | CLI entry point |
| `utils/credential_store.py` | OAuth token storage (keychain + fallback) |

## Testing

Tests use Click's `CliRunner` and subprocess calls to verify CLI help text and argument parsing. No running TIDAL instance needed.
